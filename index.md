# Computational Law: DataVR Module

Welcome to the information page for a special two-day module exploring use of "Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality for Data Analytics" (aka "DataVR" for short).  This module is part of the [2017 MIT/IAP Computational Law Course](https://law.mit.edu/Computational-Law-Course).

# Live Syllabus

* We'll keep the following syllabus page up to date with the most current scheduling information and links for materials and activities happening during the DataVR Workshop Module

### Preview of Simmetri

Amedeo Mapelli and members of his team will be on hand during the DataVR Module to work with students who wish to use Simmetri to develop VR environments for their team projects.  In some cases, student teams with little or no technical skills will be able to use new data visualizations tools being added to Simmetri to get a variety of simple projects started quickly.  Amedeo has kindly offered to assist student teams to develop more complex design goals as part of this course, as time permits.  Below is a preview of some of the new data ingestion, transformation, modeling, visualization and exploration features currently being added to Simmetri:
